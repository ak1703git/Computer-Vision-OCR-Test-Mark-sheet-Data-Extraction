# Computer-Vision-OCR-Test-Mark-sheet-Data-Extraction
In academic institutions, one of the most mundane and repetitive task is the data entry of student details and their scores once each student has been awared a score. This project aims to automate the process by first using computer vision techniquies to process images then with the help of Gimini's  API, extract student details, display them into a neat little GUI and finally enter the details into a database. For the puspose of this project the data base is a simple excel file.

## About the Dataset
The Student Dataset is fictitious. It only exists to serve as a replica of what an actual student database might look like.
The exam marksheets are also replicas of the real one and the details mentioned within them are all fictitious for demonstration purposes only.

## Core Project Outline
1. Image Scanner
2. Image Procesing
3. Data Extraction with the aid of an API
4. Validation Checks
5. GUI for shifting through images
6. Data Entry into an excel file

## Key Note Regarding the Gimini API key

I had generated a private gimini API key for the project. Please generate your own and plug it into the code section to use the code.
