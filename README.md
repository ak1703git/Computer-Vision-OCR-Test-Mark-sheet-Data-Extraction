# Computer-Vision-OCR-Test-Mark-sheet-Data-Extraction
In academic institutions, one of the most mundane and repetitive task is the data entry of student details and their scores once each student has been awared a score. This project aims to automate the process by first using computer vision techniquies to process images then with the help of Gimini's  API, extract student details, display them into a neat little GUI and finally enter the details into a database. For the puspose of this project the data base is a simple excel file.
